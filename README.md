From Baghdad to Mosul: The Rise and Fall of Iraq in ABC News (2003–2021)

When the Iraq War erupted in 2003, ABC News coverage exploded — dominated by words like “Baghdad,” “troops,” “kill,” and “bomb.” These headlines captured a world gripped by invasion, violence, and uncertainty. At its peak, coverage reached nearly 9,500 Iraq-related stories a year, reflecting the war’s global impact and urgency.

But over time, the story shifted. As large-scale combat subsided, attention moved north — from Baghdad to Mosul, a new focal point during the rise of ISIS in the 2010s. Yet even as Mosul made headlines, the overall frequency of Iraq coverage plunged.

By 2015, articles had dropped below 1,000 per year, and by 2021, Iraq had nearly vanished from the news cycle. This decline mirrors how media attention fades once conflicts “settle,” leaving behind a quieter aftermath — one still unfolding, but no longer in the global spotlight.
